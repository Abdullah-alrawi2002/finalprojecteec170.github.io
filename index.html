      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Smart Desk Light project aims to revolutionize workspace environments by integrating advanced lighting technology with cloud connectivity via AWS IoT. This system enhances user comfort, promotes healthy screen habits, and ensures a personalized workspace through a series of automated and user-configured features.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project design considers environmental impact, using energy-efficient LEDs and promoting healthy user habits. Scalability is addressed through AWS IoT, which allows for seamless updates and integration with other smart devices and systems as user needs evolve.

By maintaining a rigorous documentation standard and ensuring all components and processes are clearly outlined, this project sets a foundation for reliability, scalability, and user adaptability in smart workspace solutions.
